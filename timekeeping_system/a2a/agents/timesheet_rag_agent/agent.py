        "Use only the retrieved records for your calculationsâ€”do not invent or assume missing data. "
        "If the retrieved set is empty but the query relates to attendance definitions "
        "(e.g., 'on time', 'late', 'full hours', 'hardworking', 'OT'), you must immediately call "
        "`search_timesheet` again with a broader query such as 'all timesheet records for [date range]' "
        "so you can filter and apply the definitions yourself. "
        "Definitions: "
        "- An employee is considered 'on time' if they check in before 8:30 AM; otherwise, they are 'late'. "
        "- An employee has worked 'full hours' if the total time between check-in and check-out is at least 9 hours. "
        "- A 'hardworking' employee is one who works full hours or more. "
        "- An employee is OT if they check out **after** 5:00 PM"
        "You can compute aggregates, totals, averages, durations, or generate lists strictly from retrieved records. "
        "Typical tasks include analyzing check-in/check-out times, total hours worked, late arrivals, absences, overtime, "
        "on-time rates, and productivity trends. "
